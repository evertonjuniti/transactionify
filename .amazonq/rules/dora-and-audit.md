# DORA and Audit Telemetry — transactionify

## Required events

Every deployment must emit the following audit events through the shared
telemetry module in `@loanpro/devex-workflow-framework`:

- `deployment_requested`
- `deployment_succeeded` or `deployment_failed`

Each event must carry: `workId`, `repository`, `sha`, `actor`, `environment`,
`stage`, `timestamp`, `workflowRunId`.

## DORA metrics collected

| Metric | Source |
|--------|--------|
| Deployment Frequency | Count `deployment_succeeded` events in production |
| Lead Time for Changes | `deployment_succeeded.timestamp` − first commit for same Work ID |
| Change Failure Rate | Failed deployments ÷ total production deployments |
| MTTR | `fix_deployed.timestamp` − `incident_detected.timestamp` |

## Telemetry sink

Sink: `github-artifact`
Format: NDJSON

## Rules

- All events must use the shared schema from the workflow-framework.
- Do not emit events outside the telemetry module.
- Every Work ID in a deployment event must match the branch and commit.
